/*
Q: What is Object orianted programmin?
A: OOP is a programming paradigm(style of the code-how we write and organize the code) based on concept of objects

// we use objects to model(describe) real-world or abstract features.

objects may contain data(properties) and code(methods) .By using objects, we pack "data and corresponding behavior" into one block.

In OOP, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code.

Objects are "building blocks" of our applications, and interect with one another.

Interection happen through a "public interface"(API): Methods that the code "outside" of the object can access and use to communicate with the object.

OOP was developed with the goal of organizing code, to make it  more flexible and easier to maintain(avoid "spaghetti code")
